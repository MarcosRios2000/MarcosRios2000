# 👋 Hey, I'm Marcos Rios

I'm a software developer who started exploring web and game development in 2019. Since then, I've worked on freelance projects and led fullstack efforts in real-world environments.

## 🚀 About Me

- 🧠 Bootcamp-trained with a Henry Hero distinction and collaboration with NGOs like TECHO.
- 🛠️ Worked with React, Redux, Express, Sequelize, PostgreSQL, Vue, and React Native.
- 💪 At **Aythen**, a Spanish company, I led critical frontend architecture for a full-fledged website builder. 
    - Migrated a React + Vite codebase to Next.js.
    - Designed and implemented recursive Redux logic to manage a virtual DOM tree.
    - Built drag-and-drop and resize features from scratch (no libraries).
    - Created advanced interactions such as element reparenting, optimizing selection, and state tracking in a read-only-friendly environment.
    - Contributed to the development of a **Figma plugin** that parsed design elements and converted them to structured data, solving challenges like coordinate rotation discrepancies using applied math and custom logic.
    - Led the development of the **code translator**, a tool that converted the parsed design data into fully functional React, Vue, React Native, and HTML codebases.

## 🧠 Applied Logic & Systems Thinking

Throughout my work, especially at Aythen, I had to apply deep logical thinking and mathematical problem solving:

- 🧮 Developed recursive data manipulation to represent and traverse nested DOM structures as trees.
- 📐 Solved layout transformations between Figma and React rendering contexts using trigonometry and coordinate system analysis.
- 🧰 Created utility functions from scratch to handle complex layout problems such as element rotation, centering, and positioning within draggable UI environments.

These challenges refined not only my coding ability but also my understanding of data structures, applied mathematics, and systems design.
